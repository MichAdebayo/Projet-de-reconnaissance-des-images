# Projet-de-reconnaissance-des-images

This is a repository for a computer vision project. The goal of the project is to detect the coins in the image, determine the value of each coin, and find the total amount of the coins. The image used in this project is also included in this repository.

## Methodology

### Python Libraries

The follwoing libraries were used in this project:

* OpenCV - An open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing tasks.
* Numpy - For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations.
